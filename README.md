KISS Engine
===========

This is a graphics engine written in C using SDL. It aims to be a very simple game engine with minimal complexity. It doesn't aim to be the most full-featured and fastest engine. It's currently still VERY unfinished and unusable.

* Lilis Iskandar (veeableful)

Future plans:
- Software renderer
- Support for OpenGL below version 2.1
- Level editor
- Multi-threading
